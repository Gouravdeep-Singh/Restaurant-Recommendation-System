# Restaurant-Recommendation-System

The aim of our project is to study and analyse the given datatset about details of various kinds of restaurants in different locations and recommend best suitors according to rating, votes and reviews of the place. The datatset has been acquired through kaggle. It has over 51 thousand rows and 17 columns. Our analysis is divided into following steps: 

•	Pre processing

•	Sentiment score

•	Variance threshold

•	Recursive feature selection

•	Visualization

•	Outlier handling

•	Model Implementation


# OBSERVATIONS: 
* While evaluating the features we faced contradicting results. The output after variance threshold revealed that review column had less variability but recursive feature selection said it still holds importance. We decided to include it since from a user’s perspective reviews are essential.
* The Nearest neighbour algorithms provides us with suitable recommendation, however whether they are the best or not this cannot be evaluated.
